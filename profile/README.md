`Mass Effect Multiplayer Emulation Project`

[Website (pocket-relay.pages.dev/)](https://pocket-relay.pages.dev)

Welcome to Pocket Relay, a project dedicated to providing servers for Mass Effect 3. These servers emulate the official server functionality, allowing hosting over LAN. Additionally, I am also working on Pocket Ark, a private server for Mass Effect Andromeda.

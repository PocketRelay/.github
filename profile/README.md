# Pocket Relay

`Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer Emulation Project`

[Website (pocket-relay.pages.dev/)](https://pocket-relay.pages.dev)

Pocket Relay is a project which provides reverse engineered servers for Mass Effect 3 that emulate
the functionality of the official servers while being able to be hosted over lan.

## ðŸ“Œ EA / BioWare Notice
The Pocket Relay software in all its forms are in no way or form supported, endorsed, or provided by BioWare or Electronic Arts.

## Instructions

For instructions on creating or connecting to a server see the guides on the **Pocket Relay** website 
[Guides](https://pocket-relay.pages.dev/guide/)

## Projects

### Server (https://github.com/PocketRelay/Server)

This repository contains the Pocket Relay server implementaiton which is written in Rust

### Client (https://github.com/PocketRelay/Client)
The client application which configures client computers to be able to connect to the 
Pocket Relay server rather than the official servers.


### Blaze SSL Async (https://github.com/jacobtread/blaze-ssl-async)

This is a custom implementation of the legacy SSLv3 protocol along with the 
TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA and TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 cipher suites in order to 
support the required connections for gosredirector.ea.com. Common issue facing previous versions was finding support for this protocol and ciphers as due to how old it is most implementations require hacky solutions in order to enable it but this implementation is a pure rust implementation.

### Blaze SSL (https://github.com/jacobtread/blaze-ssl)

> Note: This is the syncronous version of Blaze SSL Async and is no longer maintained as its been superseeded by the asyncversion

This is a library which implements the SSLv3 protocol with the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA cipher which is 
required for the first redirection step of emulating Mass Effect 3 servers. This is being created to 
replace hacky tweaks with SChannel / the Java JDK SSL

### BlazePK (https://github.com/jacobtread/BlazePK-rs)

This is a library which implements the Blaze packet system which Mass Effect 3 uses. This library
implements it in the Rust language. This library takes a encoding and decoding from structures 
approach when encoding packets. Through many improvements this library now also includes a packet routing system for routing
packets to functions

### BlazeKT (https://github.com/jacobtread/BlazeKt)

This is a library which implements the Blaze packet system which Mass Effect 3 uses. This library
implements it in the Kotlin language. This library takes a DSL / Typesafe builder approach when 
encoding packets

### Archived Manager (https://github.com/PocketRelay/PocketRelayManager)

This repository previously contained the management tool used to manage players and games on 
the server. It has since been archived and replaced by the dashboard interface which is now
built into Pocket Relay.

### Archived Kotlin Server (https://github.com/PocketRelay/ServerKotlin)
This is the previous implementation of the Pocket Relay server before the current Rust server. This
server is written in Kotlin and requires a JVM to run and will no longer recieve updates.

### RedirectorClient  (https://github.com/PocketRelay/RedirectorClient )

> Note: This client implementation is no longer used and the redirector logic has been moved back
> to the server side as it was not worth proxing all the extra data.

This was a concept version of the client where rather than having the Redirector portion on the server side it was on the
client side. This was scrapped as it required more resources 
than was actually worth it

The original proof of concept for this was written in Kotlin and is archived here https://github.com/PocketRelay/ClientKotlin
